# Third answer -variables

# #boolean values. Boolean values makes decisions. Python is a case sensitive language, lower
# case and upper case characters have different meanings therefore boolean values should always start  with a capital letter

# #strings are like texts. When writing your text you have to surround your text with quotes
#in naming your variables all letters should be lower case

#Fourth answer - operators
#Arithmetic operators. They are used to perform mathematical operations
x=2
y=3
z=4

ans= (x+y+z)
ans= (x-y-z)
ans= (z+y-x)
print(ans)

#Assignment operator. They are used to assign values to variables
a=5
a += 10
print(a)

#Comparison operators. They compare two values/variables and return a boolean result.
a=5
b=5
print(a == b)
print(a<b)

#Logical oprators. They are used to check whther an expression is true or false.They are used for making decision.
a=7
b=9

print((a < 29) and (b >= 8))

#Bitwise operators. They act on operands as if they were strings of binary digits. They operate bit by bit.
x= 10
y= 4
print(x & y)
print(~x)
print(x ^ y)
print(x >> 2)
